Put any ideas into practice and try them out. When encountering difficulties, consult materials and look for different ways.

## What do you need to stop or change in your work for this subject overall so far?

Ignore other aspects because the result is correct.

## What are you currently doing poorly for practicals in this subject that you will change?

Think carefully and not just focus on the results. For example, in Prac 1, although the execution was correct, I didn't expect the problem of setting the variable as a constant.

Complete Prac to the best of my ability.
